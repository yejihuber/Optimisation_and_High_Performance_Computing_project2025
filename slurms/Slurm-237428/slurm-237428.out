==========================================
Running calibration with reduced noise scale
==========================================
Parameters:
  n_chains=10
  n_iter=250000
  burn_in=200000
  n_workers=32
  T0=0.5, sigma=1e-6

Changes:
  - Noise scale reduced: T0 from 5% to 1%
  - Constraints: T0 ±5% bounds + order preservation
