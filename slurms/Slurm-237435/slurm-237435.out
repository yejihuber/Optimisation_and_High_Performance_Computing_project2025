Running calibration with best sample selection
==========================================
Parameters:
  n_chains=10
  n_iter=250000
  burn_in=200000
  n_workers=32
  T0=0.5, sigma=1e-6

Improvements:
  - Using minimum MSE sample from each chain (instead of average)
  - Selecting best solution across all chains
  - Original noise scale: 5% for all parameters


Performance Analysis:
  Average single iteration time: 2.0363 ms
