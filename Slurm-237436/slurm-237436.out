Running calibration with histogram-based center of mass
==========================================
Parameters:
  n_chains=10
  n_iter=250000
  burn_in=200000
  n_workers=32
  T0=0.5, sigma=1e-6

Improvements:
  - Histogram-based center of mass calculation
  - Small fixed noise scale: 0.001 (like provided code)
  - All samples stored for distribution analysis
